# hyperjournal
A high-tech React/Firebase application for keeping and sharing your personal thoughts in cyberspace... the most cyberpunk way I could think to describe a blog. 

If you'd like to set one of these up on your own, you'll need to create a firebase app to run the data storage, and store its credentials in src/config/fbConfig.js. Otherwise, if you'd just like to try it out and sign up as one of my users, you can take a look here:

Enjoy!
